# Angular (19+) Observable and Signal payload using API requests

## Goals AC's

1.	Get all country names and display on the page: 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/independent?fields=name

2.	Select a country and Show the flag: 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/Grenada?fields=name,flags

3.	Search countries by language: 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/lang/spanish?fields=name

## Solution Arquitecture

```js
src/
â””â”€â”€ app/
     â”œâ”€â”€ SoC/
          â””â”€â”€ input/output   = Separation of Concern using Parent and Child, @Input()/@Output()
          â””â”€â”€ input/output   = Separation of Concern using Parent and Child, input signal/@Output()  
     â”œâ”€â”€ orphan-observable/  = single Component, managing API request using Observables
     â”œâ”€â”€ orphan-signal/      = single Component, managing API request using Signals
     â”œâ”€â”€ orphan-signal-payload-simple/  = single Component, managing API request using Signal
     â”œâ”€â”€ orphan-signal-payload-nested/  = single Component, managing complex API request using Signal
     |
     â”œâ”€â”€ app.component.ts
     â”œâ”€â”€ auth.interceptor.ts
     â””â”€â”€ http.interceptor.ts
```

## A few technical mentions
ðŸŸ¡ `SoC`
This example demonstrates the separation of concerns between the: 
`service (responsible for fetching data)`, 
`smart component (responsible for handling business logic and passing data to the dummy component)`, `dummy component (responsible for rendering the UI)` 

ðŸŸ¡ Modern StandAlone Components:
I directly bootstrap the component itself, not its module. This is because standalone components have their own injectors and don't rely on a root module for dependency injection. Promotes code maintainability, reusability, and smaller application size.

ðŸŸ¡ Implemented `TSP mechanism`:
I'm using `Tree Shakeable Providers` in `Services` by using the `providedIn` attribute, this will provide the benefits of both `tree shaking performance` and `dependency injection`,
meaning that our services will not be included in the final bundle unless they are being used by other services or components. As a result we reduce the bundle size by removing unused code from the bundle.

ðŸŸ¡ RxJS
- `takeUntilDestroyed(this.destroyRef)` to automatically unsubscribe when the component is destroyed, simplifying the cleanup process even further
- `shareReplay(1)` because multiple components might subscribe to the same observable

ðŸŸ¡ Signals and Observables
Signals will hold state values and trigger reactivity in our component, whereas Observables are streams of data that may emit multiple values over time.

ðŸŸ¡ OnPush Change Detection and Reactive Signal 
I Changed detection OnPush: So only change detection is triggered locally to the Signal change (changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush)

ðŸŸ¡ TypeScript
- TS Generic Type Parameter <T>
T can replaced with: user, photos, comments, etc. 
The method returns an Observable of `type T`

ðŸŸ¡ Dependency Injection Pattern:
I'm using Modern `Dependency Injection functions`, instead traditional `constructor-based dependency injection`as result I will have a more Modular, Less Complex

ðŸŸ¡ Implement Caching:
-- `Cache API Service Calls`
Caches identical HTTP requests within a single component:
I'm using `shareReplay()` to improve efficiency, ensuring that all subscribers receive the most recent data without triggering multiple HTTP requests.


ðŸŸ¡ `DestroyRef & takeUntilDestroyed()`: Angular 16+
I'm using provides a more declarative and efficient way to handle automatic cleanup tasks when a component or service is destroyed: `takeUntilDestroyed(this.destroyRef)` to automatically unsubscribe when the component is destroyed, simplifying the cleanup process even further


ðŸŸ¡ `Angular control flows` syntax: `@for`, `@empty`, etc
I'm using modern angular control flows, offering better runtime performance than *ngFor (especially for large lists)

ðŸŸ¡ `Function-based Interceptor` (optional here): 
It also showcases the usage of an interceptor to log HTTP requests and responses. While not necessary for this example, it can be useful for debugging and monitoring purposes (WIP)
