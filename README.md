# Angular (19.2+) Observable + Signals for handling API requests

## Goals AC's

1.	Get all country names and display on the page: 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/independent?fields=name

2.	Select a country and Show the flag: 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/Grenada?fields=name,flags

3.	Search countries by language: 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/lang/spanish?fields=name

## A few technical mentions

ðŸŸ¡ `httpResource` asynchronous data fetching (Angular 19.2+)
This feature simplifies working with RESTful APIs by providing a higher-level abstraction for interacting with resources on a server.

It is designed to reduce boilerplate code when performing common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Instead of manually writing HTTP requests for each operation, you can use HttpResource to define a resource and automatically generate methods for interacting with it. Define a resource once, and HttpResource provides methods like get(), post(), put(), delete(), etc., out of the box.

The httpResource function creates a Resource that performs an HTTP GET request to a specified URL. When provided with a reactive function for the URL, the resource updates automatically as the URL changes via signals. Under the hood, httpResource utilizes Angular's HttpClient, ensuring compatibility with existing interceptors and testing utilities.
`Instead of manually subscribing inside an effect, rxResource allows developers to declare request dependencies and automatically updates when the dependent Signal changes.`

ðŸŸ¡ `Signal with httpresource (with paramenters)`
- Reactive Forms instead template-driven
- using Signals for a clean, reactive data flow and reactive state management
- Using httpResource, with parameter, for automatic data fetching
- Implements debouncing for performance + Handles errors, in separates function for reusability
- Provides computed values for derived state
- Stays within the signals paradigm and use signals' effect() to automatically handle cleanup (instead OnInit/OnDestroy + No need for manual subscription management)


ðŸŸ¡ `SoC`
This example demonstrates the separation of concerns between the: 
`service (responsible for fetching data)`, 
`smart component (responsible for handling business logic and passing data to the dummy component)`, `dummy component (responsible for rendering the UI)` 

ðŸŸ¡ `Modern StandAlone Components`:
I directly bootstrap the component itself, not its module. This is because standalone components have their own injectors and don't rely on a root module for dependency injection. Promotes code maintainability, reusability, and smaller application size.

ðŸŸ¡ Implemented `TSP mechanism`:
I'm using `Tree Shakeable Providers` in `Services` by using the `providedIn` attribute, this will provide the benefits of both `tree shaking performance` and `dependency injection`,
meaning that our services will not be included in the final bundle unless they are being used by other services or components. As a result we reduce the bundle size by removing unused code from the bundle.

ðŸŸ¡ `RxJS`
- `takeUntilDestroyed(this.destroyRef)` to automatically unsubscribe when the component is destroyed, simplifying the cleanup process even further
- `shareReplay(1)` because multiple components might subscribe to the same observable

ðŸŸ¡ `Signals and Observables`
- Prefer Signals Over BehaviorSubjects for State Management
- Signals will hold state values and trigger reactivity in our component, whereas Observables are streams of data that may emit multiple values over time.

ðŸŸ¡ `OnPush Change Detection and Reactive Signal` 
I Changed detection OnPush: So only change detection is triggered locally to the Signal change (changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush)

ðŸŸ¡ `TypeScript`
- TS Generic Type Parameter <T>
T can replaced with: user, photos, comments, etc. 
The method returns an Observable of `type T`

ðŸŸ¡ `Dependency Injection Pattern`:
I'm using Modern `Dependency Injection functions`, instead traditional `constructor-based dependency injection`as result I will have a more Modular, Less Complex

ðŸŸ¡ Implement Caching:
-- `Cache API Service Calls`
Caches identical HTTP requests within a single component:
I'm using `shareReplay()` to improve efficiency, ensuring that all subscribers receive the most recent data without triggering multiple HTTP requests.


ðŸŸ¡ `DestroyRef & takeUntilDestroyed()`: Angular 16+
I'm using provides a more declarative and efficient way to handle automatic cleanup tasks when a component or service is destroyed: `takeUntilDestroyed(this.destroyRef)` to automatically unsubscribe when the component is destroyed, simplifying the cleanup process even further


ðŸŸ¡ `Angular control flows` syntax: `@for`, `@empty`, etc
I'm using modern angular control flows, offering better runtime performance than *ngFor (especially for large lists)

ðŸŸ¡ `Function-based Interceptor` (optional here): 
It also showcases the usage of an interceptor to log HTTP requests and responses. While not necessary for this example, it can be useful for debugging and monitoring purposes (WIP)
