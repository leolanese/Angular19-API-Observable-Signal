# Angular (19+) Observable and Signal payload using API requests

## Goals AC's

1.	Get all country names and display on the page: 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/independent?fields=name

2.	Select a country and Show the flag: 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/Grenada?fields=name,flags

3.	Search countries by language: 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/lang/spanish?fields=name

## Solution Arquitecture

```js
src/
â””â”€â”€ app/
     â”œâ”€â”€ SoC/
          â””â”€â”€ input/output   = Separation of Concern using Parent and Child, @Input()/@Output()
          â””â”€â”€ input/output   = Separation of Concern using Parent and Child, input signal/@Output()  
     â”œâ”€â”€ orphan-observable/  = single Component, managing API request using Observables
     â”œâ”€â”€ orphan-signal/      = single Component, managing API request using Signals
     â”œâ”€â”€ orphan-signal-payload-simple/  = single Component, managing API request using Signal
     â”œâ”€â”€ orphan-signal-payload-nested/  = single Component, managing complex API request using Signal
     |
     â”œâ”€â”€ app.component.ts
     â”œâ”€â”€ auth.interceptor.ts
     â””â”€â”€ http.interceptor.ts
```

## A few technical mentions
ðŸŸ¡ `SoC`
This example demonstrates the separation of concerns between the: 
`service (responsible for fetching data)`, 
`smart component (responsible for handling business logic and passing data to the dummy component)`, 
`dummy component (responsible for rendering the UI)` 

ðŸŸ¡ `Function-based Interceptor`: 
It also showcases the usage of an interceptor to log HTTP requests and responses.

ðŸŸ¡ RxJS
- `takeUntilDestroyed(this.destroyRef)` to automatically unsubscribe when the component is destroyed, simplifying the cleanup process even further
- `shareReplay(1)` because multiple components might subscribe to the same observable

ðŸŸ¡ Signals and Observables
Signals will hold state values and trigger reactivity in our component, whereas Observables are streams of data that may emit multiple values over time.

ðŸŸ¡ OnPush Change Detection and Reactive Signal 
I Changed detection OnPush: So only change detection is triggered locally to the Signal change (changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush)

ðŸŸ¡ TypeScript
- TS Generic Type Parameter <T>
T can replaced with: user, photos, comments, etc. 
The method returns an Observable of type T
